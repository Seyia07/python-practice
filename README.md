## Project Description
This repository contains my solutions to Python practice questions for my programming fundamentals course.

## Task List
1. Sum all elements in a list (`task1_sum_list.py`)
2. Check if a number is even or odd (`task2_even_odd.py`)
3. Compute factorial using a loop (`task3_factorial_loop.py`)
4. Reverse a string without using built-in methods (`task4_string_reverse.py`)
5. Factorial using recursion (`task5_factorial_recursive.py`)
6. Sum of digits of a number (`task6_sum_digits.py`)

## Implementation Approach
- Each task is solved using Python functions.
- Comments are added in the code to explain my thought process.
- Code is written without AI assistance.
- Regular commits track my progress.

## Self-Declaration
I confirm that:
- All code in this repository is written by me.
- I did not copy code from AI tools or other students.
- I understand the logic behind every implementation.
- I have tested each script thoroughly.
