## Project Description
This repository contains my solutions to Python practice questions for my programming fundamentals course.

## Task List
1. Sum all elements in a list (`Elements-sum-list.py`)
2. Check if a number is even or odd (`Even-Odd.py`)
3. Compute factorial using a loop (`Factorial-Loop.py`)
4. Reverse a string without using built-in methods (`String-Reverse.py`)
5. Factorial using recursion (`Factorial-Recursive.py`)
6. Sum of digits of a number (`Digits-Sum.py`)

## Implementation Approach
- Each task is solved using Python functions.
- Some comments are added in the code to explain my thought process.
  
## Self-Declaration
I confirm that:
- All code in this repository is written by me.
- I did not copy code from AI tools or other students.
- I had some assistance from my friends in understanding how to write the codes.
- I understand the logic behind every implementation.
- I have tested each script thoroughly.
